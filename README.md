## Flexbox

- There is a main axis and a cross axis. Elements are laid out along the main axis. This can be horizontally or verticaly depending on `felx-direction`.
- Some properties are assigned to the flex container and some to the items
- There should always be one a flex container around the flex items
- By default a flex-container tries to fit all it's items into one line, even overwriting fixed width values of the items.
- Gap is useful to have gaps...

## Grid

## Clamp

ðŸ¤¯ `width: clamp(200px, 50%, 600px) sets layout to (min, preferred, max) width. Amazing. ðŸ’ª
